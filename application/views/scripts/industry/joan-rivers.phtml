				<p>Joan Rivers was born in Brooklyn, in the Big Apple, before entering show business, Rivers worked at assorted roles like a tour guide at Rockefeller Center, a writer / proofreader at an advertising corporation and as a fashion specialist at Bond outfitters. In this period, an agent named Tony Rivers instructed her to change her name, so she advised Joan Brooks as her new name. </p>
				<p>By 1965, Rivers had a stint on Candid Camera as a gag writer and participant; she was &quot;the bait&quot; to lure folks into stupid eventualities for the show. She also made her first appearance on The Tonight Show with new host Johnny Carson, on February 17th, 1965. </p>
				<p>In the same decade, Brooks made other appearances on The Tonight Show as well as The Ed Sullivan Show, while hosting the 1st of several talk shows.

Also in 1986 came the move  that cost Brooks her longtime closeness with Carson, who had first  employed her as a Tonight Show writer. The soon-to-launch Fox TV  Network claimed it was giving her a late night talk show, The Late  Show Starring Joan Rivers.</p>

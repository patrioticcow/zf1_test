			<div class="content_paragraph">
				<p>Before the death of Cobain and Nirvana, Grohl had been working on some music of his very own. Nonetheless he was so split up about Cobain's death that he just about give up playing music totally. However, Grohl persisted with assistance from friends and kept making what would be the 1st Foo Fighers album.  Grohl played all the instruments (he has played the guitar since age ten) on the album--which was called Foo Wrestlers and was released on July four, 1995--except for Greg Dulli's (the lead vocalist of Afghan Whigs) guitar part on the track "X-Static." Grohl wanted to tour to support the album, but he had no band.  He soon found the pieces, though: Pat Smear, who had joined Nirvana as its 2nd guitar player, and former BrightDay property members Nate Mendel (bass) and William Goldsmith (drums).  Grohl emerged--or rather, burst--from the behind the drum kit to play the guitar and sing for Foo Wrestlers.  Foo Wrestlers went platinum and spawned 3 hit singles: "This Is A Call," "I will Stick Around," and" Giant Me." Grohl's primal howling and outwardly endless energy on stage impressed many.
					The band was turning into a force.
					An amalgamation of live Nirvana performances became the album From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, which was released in 1996 and signified the true end of the Nirvana and grunge time.  Grohl, in the meantime, returned in the studio and commenced recording Foo Wrestlers' 2nd album, which would be called The Color And The Shape.  This project was changed for Grohl as he was working this time not only with band members, but as a band leader.  During recording nonetheless, Goldsmith made a decision to leave the band, so Grohl took control of drum needs again (although Goldsmith did play drums on the cuts "Doll" and the   slow part of "Up In Arms").  Grohl was capable of finding a new drummer comparatively swiftly. Right after the recording of The Color And The Shape, Taylor Hawkins, who had most lately played with Alanis Morissette, joined the band. Hawkins' photograph appeared in the liner   notes for The Color And The Shape, although he did not play on the album.  The Color And The Shape was released on June twenty, 1997, and generated 4 hits: "Monkey Wrench," "Everlong," "My Hero," and "Walking After You." The Foos get going right after, but in the autumn of 1997, the band lost another member.
					At the MTV Video Music Awards, Pat Smear expounded he was leaving the band, and Foo Wrestlers introduced Franz Stahl, one of Grohl's previous bandmates in Scream, to take Smear's spot.  Touring supporting The Color And The Shape, Foo Wrestlers continued to firm up their place as the kings of post-grunge rock.</p>

				<div class="title_text">A few words from Dave Grohl</div>
			</div>
			<div class="content_paragraph">
				<p>Dave Grohl, is considered by many to be one of the best rock 'n roll drummers, but lately he has additionally made a big rep for himself as a lead frontman and guitar player in the post-grunge age of preferred music.  Grohl commenced playing drums in punk bands in the 1980s, beginning with Freak Baby, which became Mission Very unlikely and later modified again to Fast.  After Fast split up, Grohl joined the band Dain Bramage, and just after he auditioned for Scream.  At age sixteen, Grohl became the drummer for Scream, and the band shortly commenced touring across the U.S.  In 1987 and later in Europe
					After being on the road at length, the Foos rested a bit and then prepared to record another album.  Stahl left the band after the tour, and Foo Wrestlers turned into a threesome for the there's nothing Left To Lose sessions.
					Grohl, Hawkins, and Mendel went to Grohl's house in Virginia to make the 3rd Foo  Wrestlers  album in the spring of 1999.
					Then came Nirvana.  Kurt Cobain--lead guitarist, composer, and singer--and Krist Novoselic--bass player--saw Grohl drumming for Scream and were so blown away that they asked him to join the band in 1990.  Nirvana had   already released their first album, Bleach (on which Dale Crover and Chad Channing played drums), in 1989 and shortly started working with Grohl on their follow-up album, which would be called Nevermind.  Nevermind was released on Sep, twenty-four, 1991, raged to the top of the charts, and played chaos on the popular music scene. Hard hitting, yet melodic, Nevermind led the charge for grunge and "alternative" music, which also included the bands Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains.  Grohl's whacking backbeats and raucous rolls with a Ringo Starr-esque touch helped elevate Nirvana as the most significant rock group of the '90s.  Incesticide, a collection of B-sides and demos, followed Nevermind, with Grohl playing drums on six of the fifteen cuts.  Then came In Utero, released on Sep twenty-one, 1993, and widely thought to be Nirvana's masterwork.
					Sadly, seven months later on Cobain snuffed out himself, and Nirvana was done.
					MTV Unplugged in NY, recorded on  Nov  eighteen, 1993, was released after Cobain's death in the autumn of 1994.
					David Grohl and Foo Fighters are setting the stage for new hits and are supposed to headline for music awards this year.</p>
